SpaceInvaders
=============

Okay guys,

I've completed all the MovingScreenObjects as I said I would. I'm done with my portion of the code, as we all agreed, and I'm now going to focus on another project I have due soon. If you guys have any questions, don't hesitate to ask, but I'm done with writing code. As you can see, the shots are fully operational. Here's a list of things you guys need to consider:

Score display, 
Lives display, 
Scores being totaled, 
Levels, 
Collisions, 
Beginning screen ("Press Enter to Continue"), 
Game Over - when it occurs and how it is displayed.

I can't really think of anything else. Good luck, guys! I'll make myself available as much as I can.

Thanks,

Derick.
